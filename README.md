# A \* Path Finding Algorithm

Version 1.0.0

A visualization of the A \* path finding algorithm using a pygame GUI interface.

This algorithm allows you to select a start and end location and will create a visualization of the A \* algorithm finding hte shortest path.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TKinter
- Pygame

## Instillation

    Instal python 3.x to you local computer and then run a pip install of Tkinter and pygame.

## Instructions
